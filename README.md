# Task Management & To-Do List App

I built this project based on a **Figma design** from the community called **“Task Management & To-Do List App.”**

The original design was made for **mobile**, and I **converted it to a web app** layout.  
You can view the original design here:  
[Task Management & To-Do List App (Figma Community)](https://www.figma.com/design/PUqJiEZDFNUXDE5tXLfz8C/Task-management---to-do-list-app--Community-?node-id=101-125&t=a8KfznkyrBZzTgj3-0)

## 🛠️ What I Used

- **Figma** to get the free design  
- **HTML5 semantic tags** for clean and structured code  
- **Tailwind CSS** for fast and consistent styling  
- **Dynamic units** (`rem`, `em`, `vw`, `vh`) for better responsiveness  
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** library to add smooth scrolling animations  
- **Responsive layout** that adapts to all screen sizes

---

## 🚀 The Challenge

The main challenge was that the design was **for a mobile app**.  
I **imagined and rebuilt it as a web app**, making sure the layout, spacing, and animations worked well across desktop and tablet screens.

## 🎯 Bonus

Added **scroll animations** using AOS to enhance the visual flow of the page.

## ✅ Result

- Fully responsive  
- Smooth animations  
- Clean and semantic code  
- Fast and maintainable styling with Tailwind CSS
